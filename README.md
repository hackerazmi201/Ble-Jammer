# Ble-Jammer
Ble-jammer is a hardware-based BLE interference/testing toolkit that uses an ESP32 (for control and RF activation) together with nRF-series radio modules to generate controlled Bluetooth Low Energy interference and test resilience of BLE devices in a lab environment. The project provides firmware, scripts,

# Installation of Code in ESP-32
## Step 1 :-
<ul><li> Connect your ESP-32 with your laptop/computer using USB </li></ul>
<ul><li> chech driver if in your system dont have an driver then download according to you ESP-32 Chip see on the chip on your esp32</li></ul>
<ul><li>if chip is CP2102 Chip  then download <a href="https://www.silabs.com/developers/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers">link</a>  </li></ul>
<ul><li>if your chip is CH341 chip then download driver <a href="https://www.wch-ic.com/downloads/ch341ser_exe.html">Link</a> </li></ul>

## step 2 :-
<ul>Go to this site https://esp32-bluejammerflasher.pages.dev/ and then connect your esp32 and they show your esp32 then click on it, when installing make sure click and hold the boot button on your esp32 </ul>
<ul> its may take few minutes and its done next step is wiring  </ul>
