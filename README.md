# Ble-Jammer
Ble-jammer is a hardware-based BLE interference/testing toolkit that uses an ESP32 (for control and RF activation) together with nRF-series radio modules to generate controlled Bluetooth Low Energy interference and test resilience of BLE devices in a lab environment. The project provides firmware, scripts,
